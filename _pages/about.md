Currently, I am a senior at the [School of the Gifted Young](https://sgy.ustc.edu.cn/) [The University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) (USTC, Hefei, China) since 2020. 
My research focuses on machine learning theory, with an emphasis on the statistical and computational capabilities of foun-dation models and generative AI. My goal is to develop new strong models and methods for important scientific and societial problems, with robust (i.e., low-assumption and realistic) theoretical guarantees to ensure their empirical performance. With this aim, my research interests span machine learning, optimization, statistics, and computational complexity theory.
