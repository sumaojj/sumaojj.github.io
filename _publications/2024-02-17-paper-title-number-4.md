excerpt: 'We explored the computational limits of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) update for fine-tuning transformer-based models.
Further, we identified a phase transition behavior in LoRA adaptation on transfomer-based model and proved the existence of nearly linear algorithms for gradient computation by controlling the LoRA update term by term.'
